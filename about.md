    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>
      I am currently studying Principles of Information Systems (SITE 1101).  
      I enjoy building web projects with Jekyll, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,  
      and I’m passionate about creating clean, responsive, and user-friendly designs.

    <h2>Qualifications</h2>
    <p>
      I am a first-year IT student at ADA University with a strong interest in technology and systems. I am an active BCC volunteer, which has helped me develop teamwork, communication, and responsibility skills. In my free time, I actively play football and chess, activities that strengthen my discipline, strategic thinking, and problem-solving abilities. I am motivated to continuously improve my technical knowledge and practical skills in information technology.
